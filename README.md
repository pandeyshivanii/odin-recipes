# Odin Recipes Project

This is the **Odin Recipes** project, which is part of The Odin Project curriculum. In this project, we will be creating a simple static website that displays different recipes. The goal is to practice using HTML and CSS to build and style the website.

### Skills Demonstrated:
- **HTML**: Structuring web pages with semantic HTML tags.
- **CSS**: Styling the website, including layout and typography.
- **File organization**: Properly structuring a project with folders and files.
- **Git**: Version control and pushing code to GitHub.

### Reflection:
By the end of this project, I will have a better understanding of how to create a simple, well-organized static website and enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and Git.
