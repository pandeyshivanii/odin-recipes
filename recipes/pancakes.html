    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Butter or oil for frying</li>
        <li>Optional toppings: syrup, berries, whipped cream, or chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmixâ€”the batter should be slightly lumpy.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or frying pan over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with your favorite toppings such as syrup, butter, fruit, or whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
